	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			I'm a freshman here at Lewis majoring in Computer Science. I commute from home where I have a cat and two dogs. Their names are Layla, Molly and
			<br>Pumpkin. The picture above is of my girlfriend Bella and I at Multnomah Falls in Oregon, where we vacationed last summer.
		</p>
	
	<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>More of HTML + CSS!</li>
			<li>Python and Javascript Integration</li>
			<li>Program functions</li>
			<li>More coding standards/fundamentals</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>My Favorite Hobbies/Activities</h3>
		<p>
			In my freetime I enjoy flying my DJI Mavic Air 2 drone, riding my bike, taking care of my fish and watching sports.
			<br> My favorite sports to watch are football and hockey. I'm a huge Blackhwaks fan if you couldn't tell by the theme
			<br> of this webpage!
		</p>

	<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
		<p>
			I really enjoy travelling. This summer Bella and I made that trip to Oregon completely by car. I drove over 64 hours
			<br> round trip. We drove through Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Washington before
			<br> arriving to our destination AirBNB in Oregon :)
